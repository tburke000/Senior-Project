# Senior-Project
Senior Project at Vermont Technical College for the Knight's Party Table.
Our project will be renovating the games and hardware found on the Knight's Party Table at Vermont Tech. This includes ensuring users follow the game rules in Checkers, Chess, and Battleship, as well as designing and implementing Settlers of Catan and Tim's Text-Based RPG for the table.
